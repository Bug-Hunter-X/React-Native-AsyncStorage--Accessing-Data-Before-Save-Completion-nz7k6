# React Native AsyncStorage: Data Access Before Save Completion

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications when working with AsyncStorage.  The problem involves attempting to retrieve data from AsyncStorage before the asynchronous save operation has completed.  This often leads to unexpected behavior, including receiving `undefined` values or application crashes.

The example shows a scenario where concurrent asynchronous operations further complicate the issue. This makes it harder to predict when the data will be reliably available for retrieval.

The solution provided focuses on properly handling the asynchronous nature of AsyncStorage operations using Promises or async/await, ensuring data is accessed only after successful saving.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app.  Observe the inconsistent behavior in accessing the data.

## Solution

The solution utilizes async/await, providing a cleaner and more predictable way to handle asynchronous data storage and retrieval with AsyncStorage.
